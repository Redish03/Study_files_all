<p>If you add <strong>Strong</oops> text and <em>emphasised</doh> text but forget to close your tags, that doesn't cause the worst problems.</ohno>
<p>All that happens is your text continue to be bold and emphasized.</ohno>

<p>But not closing a `style` or `script` is a more serious issue. 
  <p>The script only shows because we changed the display.
  <style>
    p {
      color:red;
    }
    style {
      display: unset;
     }
